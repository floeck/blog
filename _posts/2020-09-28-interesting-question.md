Dear Reader,

The other day my father showed me this interesting book, one filled with strange questions and thought-provoking scenarios. I can't remember what it was called, but I believe it was written by the author of XKCD's.

Okay after some googling I've [found it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If%3F_(book)). Now given the book explores answers to questions such as the one I'm about to write about, I thought I'd see what I can come up with on my own, and later follow up with a post comparing my own work to that of the book. Now for the question: 

> If two immortal people were placed on opposite sides of an uninhabited Earth-like planet, how long would it take them to find each other? 100,000 years? 1,000,000 years? 100,000,000,000 years? -- Ethan Lake

I think this is such a great question. It immediately gets my brain going and firing in a multitude of different directions. To start with, I want to lay out some assumptions I'm going to make for my analysis.

### Assumptions

1. The two people

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
